# @salicio dotfiles

These are my config files to set up my systems. (based on @holman's dotfiles)

## Installation

    git clone --recursive git://github.com/salicio/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
    cd ~/.dotfiles
    rake install

The install rake task will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your home directory. 
Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`, though.
